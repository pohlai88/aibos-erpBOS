# Version Management Rules

## Configuration Consistency
- **ALWAYS** maintain consistent versions across config files
- **ALWAYS** use international (ISO 8601) date format
- **NEVER** allow version drift between related files
- **ALWAYS** update .nvmrc, package.json, and .pnpmrc together

## Prohibited Actions
- Creating files without verification
- Leaving legacy files behind
- Using deprecated configuration formats
- Bypassing architectural boundaries
- Compromising test quality
- Creating documentation without request
- Using hardcoded styles
- Making assumptions about codebase structure
