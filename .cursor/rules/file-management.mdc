# File Management Rules

## MANDATORY File Cleanup
- **ALWAYS** remove legacy files when creating new ones
- **NEVER** leave duplicate or orphaned files behind  
- **ALWAYS** verify file cleanup after refactoring
- **NEVER** create files without prior verification and approval

## Enforcement Actions
- Before creating any new file, check for existing similar files
- After refactoring, remove all legacy/old files immediately
- Verify workspace cleanliness after each operation
- Ask for explicit approval before creating new files
