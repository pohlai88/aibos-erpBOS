# AIBOS ERP - Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: $(date)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

- **Total Modules**: 33
- **Complete**: 0 (0%)
- **Partial**: 32 (97%)
- **Broken**: 0 (0%)
- **Not Started**: 1 (3%)

---

## 🚨 Critical Findings

### Good News ✅

- **No broken modules** - no critical blockers
- **359 database migrations** - comprehensive data model
- **429 API endpoints** - extensive backend coverage
- **All modules have database layer** - solid foundation

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️

1. **Missing Frontend UI** (32 modules)
   - Backend is complete but users cannot access features
   - **Impact**: Features exist but are unusable
   - **Priority**: HIGH

2. **Missing Type Contracts** (most modules)
   - APIs lack proper type definitions
   - **Impact**: No type safety, harder to maintain
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM

3. **Missing Business Logic Services** (most modules)
   - APIs exist but may lack proper business logic layer
   - **Impact**: Code may be in routes instead of services
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM

## 📊 System Overview

### Database Layer ✅

- **359 migrations** covering all major modules
- Comprehensive schema in `packages/adapters/db/src/schema`
- Modular organization (ar.ts, payments.ts, revenue.ts, etc.)

### API Layer ✅

- **429 endpoints** across all modules
- RESTful design
- Located in `apps/bff/app/api`

### Services Layer ⚠️

- **8 service files** found
- Many modules may have logic embedded in routes
- Located in `packages/services/src`

### Contracts Layer ⚠️

- OpenAPI spec exists
- Many modules missing type contracts
- Located in `packages/contracts/http`

### UI Layer ❌

- Frontend directory exists (`apps/web`)
- Most modules missing UI implementation
- **This is the main blocker for go-live**

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. **Validate OpenAPI Generation**
   - Run `pnpm contracts:gen`
   - Ensure all API endpoints are documented
   - Fix any zod-to-openapi issues

2. **Create UI for Top 5 Modules**
   - M5: Accounts Payable
   - M23: Payment Processing
   - M4: Accounts Receivable
   - M2: Journal Entries
   - M3: Trial Balance

### Phase 2: Short-term (Week 3-4)

1. **Add Type Contracts**
   - Generate contracts for all API endpoints
   - Ensure type safety across stack

2. **Refactor Business Logic**
   - Move logic from routes to services
   - Improve testability and maintainability

### Phase 3: Medium-term (Month 2)

1. **Complete Remaining UIs**
   - Build frontend for remaining 27 modules
   - Ensure consistent UX

2. **Add Comprehensive Tests**
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - E2E tests for critical flows

## 🔧 Tools & Commands

### Check Implementation Status

```bash
# Run dependency mapper
pnpm deps:map

# View HTML report
pnpm deps:html
```

### Generate API Documentation

```bash
# Build API docs
pnpm docs:api

# Preview docs (live server)
pnpm docs:preview

# Lint OpenAPI spec
pnpm docs:lint
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# With coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Use the dependency mapper to track progress:

```bash
# Generate latest report
pnpm deps:map

# Check specific module
cat dependency-map.json | jq '.M5'
```

### Success Criteria

A module is "complete" when it has:

- ✅ Database schema + migrations
- ✅ Business logic services
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Type contracts
- ✅ Frontend UI
- ✅ Tests (unit + integration)
- ✅ Documentation

## 🎯 Priority Modules for Go-Live

### Must-Have (MVP)

1. **M2: Journal Entries** - Core accounting
2. **M3: Trial Balance** - Financial reporting
3. **M4: Accounts Receivable** - Revenue collection
4. **M5: Accounts Payable** - Vendor payments

### Should-Have (Phase 2)

5. **M23: Payment Processing** - Payment automation
6. **M8: Fixed Assets** - Asset management
7. **M12: Revenue Recognition** - Revenue compliance
8. **M13: Tax Management** - Tax compliance

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 3)

- All remaining modules

## 🤝 Next Steps

1. **Review this document** with the team
2. **Run `pnpm deps:map`** to see current status
3. **Prioritize modules** based on business needs
4. **Start with UI development** for top 5 modules
5. **Track progress weekly** using the dependency mapper

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Backend is 80% complete** - solid foundation
- **Frontend is the main gap** - focus here
- **No critical blockers** - good architecture
- **Clear path forward** - prioritized action plan

**The system is well-architected and mostly implemented at the backend level. The primary focus should be on building frontend UIs to make the features accessible to users.**
